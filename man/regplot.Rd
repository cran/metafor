\details{
   The function draws a scatter plot of the values of a moderator variable in a meta-regression model (on the x-axis) against the observed effect sizes or outcomes (on the y-axis). The regression line from the model (with corresponding confidence interval bounds) is added to the plot by default. These types of plots are also often referred to as \sQuote{bubble plots} as the points are typically drawn in different sizes to reflect their precision or weight in the model.

   If the model includes multiple moderators, one must specify via argument \code{mod} either the position (as a number) or the name (as a string) of the moderator variable to place on the x-axis. The regression line then reflects the \sQuote{marginal} relationship between the chosen moderator and the effect sizes or outcomes (i.e., all other moderators except the one being plotted are held constant at their means).

   By default (i.e., when \code{psize} is not specified), the size of the points is a function of the square root of the model weights. This way, their area is proportional to the weights. However, the point sizes are rescaled so that the smallest point size is \code{plim[1]} and the largest point size is \code{plim[2]}. As a result, their relative sizes (i.e., areas) no longer exactly correspond to their relative weights. If exactly relative point sizes are desired, one can set \code{plim[2]} to \code{NA}, in which case the points are rescaled so that the smallest point size corresponds to \code{plim[1]} and all other points are scaled accordingly. As a result, the largest point may be very large. Alternatively, one can set \code{plim[1]} to \code{NA}, in which case the points are rescaled so that the largest point size corresponds to \code{plim[2]} and all other points are scaled accordingly. As a result, the smallest point may be very small. To avoid the latter, one can also set \code{plim[3]}, which enforces a minimal point size.

   One can also set \code{psize} to a scalar (e.g., \code{psize=1}) to avoid that the points are drawn in different sizes. One can also specify the point sizes manually by passing a vector of the appropriate length to \code{psize}. Finally, one can also set \code{psize} to either \code{"seinv"} or \code{"vinv"} to make the point sizes proportional to the inverse standard errors or inverse sampling variances.

   With the \code{label} argument, one can control whether points in the plot will be labeled. If \code{label="all"} (or \code{label=TRUE}), all points in the plot will be labeled. If \code{label="ciout"} or \code{label="piout"}, points falling outside of the confidence/prediction interval will be labeled. Alternatively, one can set this argument to a logical or numeric vector to specify which points should be labeled. The labels are placed above the points when they fall above the regression line and otherwise below. With the \code{offset} argument, one can adjust the distance between the labels and the corresponding points. This can either be a single numeric value, which is used as a multiplicative factor for the point sizes (so that the distance between labels and points is larger for larger points) or a numeric vector with two values, where the first is used as an additive factor independent of the point sizes and the second again as a multiplicative factor for the point sizes. The values are given as percentages of the y-axis range. It may take some trial and error to find two values for the \code{offset} argument so that the labels are placed right next to the boundary of the points. With \code{labsize}, one can control the size of the labels.

   One can also pass an object from \code{\link[=predict.rma]{predict}} to the \code{pred} argument. This can be useful when the meta-regression model reflects a more complex relationship between the moderator variable and the effect sizes or outcomes (e.g., when using polynomials or splines) or when the model involves interactions. In this case, one also needs to specify the \code{xvals} argument. See \sQuote{Examples}.
}
\note{
   For certain types of models, it may not be possible to draw the prediction interval bounds (if this is the case, a warning will be issued).

   Argument \code{slab} and when specifying vectors for arguments \code{pch}, \code{psize}, \code{col}, \code{bg}, and/or \code{label} (for a logical vector), the variables specified are assumed to be of the same length as the data passed to the model fitting function (and if the \code{data} argument was used in the original model fit, then the variables will be searched for within this data frame first). Any subsetting and removal of studies with missing values is automatically applied to the variables specified via these arguments.

   If the outcome measure used for creating the plot is bounded (e.g., correlations are bounded between -1 and +1, proportions are bounded between 0 and 1), one can use the \code{olim} argument to enforce those limits (the observed outcomes and confidence/prediction intervals cannot exceed those bounds then).
}
\value{
   An object of class \code{"regplot"} with components:
   \item{slab}{the study labels}
   \item{ids}{the study ids}
   \item{xi}{the x-axis coordinates of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{yi}{the y-axis coordinates of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{pch}{the plotting symbols of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{psize}{the point sizes of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{col}{the colors of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{bg}{the background colors of the points that were plotted.}
   \item{label}{logical vector indicating whether a point was labeled.}

   Note that the object is returned invisibly. Using \code{points.regplot}, one can redraw the points (and labels) in case one wants to superimpose the points on top of any elements that were added manually to the plot (see \sQuote{Examples}).
